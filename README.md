## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This purpose of this project is to get experience with MongoDB and Mongoose as well as more practice with routes.  The mongoDB routes are a little different from the express.js routes since most of the route code takes place in the controllers instead of the actual routes folder.  The routes folder is used for organization and listing routes under each address.

The biggest issue I ran into during this project was the use of update user/thoughts.  The syntax for update is a little different compared to the other routes but so I made mistakes on both user and thought routes. 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

There are no steps to install the app but the server must be started.  Please use "npm start" to bring the server online and experience the app.

## Usage

Once the server is live the routes that I worked on will be live.  The routes will be demostrated in a video which can be found here:
